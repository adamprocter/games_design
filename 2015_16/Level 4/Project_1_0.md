> When the image is new, the world is new - Gaston Bachelard, The Poetics of Space

### Intro
What we capture from first hand experience is invaluable in informing what we shape in our minds about that experience. First impressions matter but equally what we choose to include from an encounter says something about who we are.

### Task
Working in given teams you are to explore a specific location within Winchester and create a physical response to it in the form of a portable 3D structure.

#### MONDAY
Please find your given location at the end of this brief. Once on location you will record what you see, hear, smell, feel. You must use **ONLY** a audio recorder to capture a description of your location. Try to gather as much information as possible whilst at your location. Consider descriptive language in response to the space, feelings evoked, items you can see and nature, and the essence of the place. Your audio description will be the focal point for your response back in the studio.


Group locations http://dctr.pro/map
1. Mollys Den
2. Winnall Moors
3. Skate Park
4. Peninsula Barracks
5. Hyde Abbey Gardens
6. Cathedral Crypt
7. D&G Hardware Store 

#### TUESDAY
All teams will be given a starter kit containing; cardboard, tape, pens, adhesive and found objects, but you should add to this from things that you find yourself. Use these to create the outcome of this project in the forms of a portable 3D structure. Each member of your team should contribute to the construction of your structure.

### Considerations
Observe and explore. Consider: colour, texture, language, relationships, people, mannerisms, sounds, social life, culture, racial or socio demographics, landscape, architecture, weather, infrastructure, transport, food, fashion, signage, horticulture and anything that you feel is indicative to the particular visual character of your place. At first you may feel that where you are is just like anywhere else, but you need to drill down and reflect more deeply on what is there. 

Remember you need to capture all of this as an audio description, and this **MUST** be the **ONLY** reference you will have when building your structure in the studio.

### Visual Inspiration
