# Understand 
### 1.2 Analyse & Reflect

> It seems to me that the creative process is one that re-examines those things we already know and understand, and forces us to reconsider them, usually involving insight to their nature. The creative act is an act that transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary – Saul Bass


### Intro
This assignment introduces and examines processes for visual analysis. You will take part in a series of workshops and exercises that will help you understand how to analyse visual material and establish creative insights. At the end of the assignment you will make a series of conclusions and present them in a sequence.

### Task
You are required to expand upon the body of work undertaken so far, and then through a series of workshops and discussions look at how to analyse this material. You will examine, unpack, collate, adapt, combine, connect and expand upon what you’ve captured in order to get to the visual essence of what you have been looking at. Workshops will help you edit and create sequences from what you have produced. You will take part in Library workshops that will look at the associated contextual references attached to what you are working on and challenge your understanding of what you originally captured in Brighton. 

You will then create a sequence of images that will communicate some insight into the place you have visited and bind these together into an order that reveals your insight. 

You will present this work on Monday 26th of October within a student led critique.
