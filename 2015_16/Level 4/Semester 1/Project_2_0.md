### Intro

This project moves forward from Project 1.0 into another core skill for games design – being able to interpret content in exciting, original and lateral ways. 

You will need to use the investigative skills learnt in Project 1.0, along with this new content and new workshops skills to produce a vibrant portfolio of work and a working prototype.

### Task
This assignment asks you to bring familiar subject matter alive through your own interpretation and find outcomes that allow somebody to look at it in new ways. Your subject is Shakespeare’s Romeo & Juliet – a very familiar and somewhat tired text this requires you to find new and interesting ways to excite an audience about what you find. However core to your decisions around content is that the movement you choose plays the key driver in your game, this project is all about **mechanics first**. 

A number of versions of Romeo & Juliet use dance and movement too play a key role, looking at either the Royal Ballet or West side story interpretations, you will need to identify a movement within the play/ film that will form the core mechanic for a game you will research and develop as teams. Ultimately You need to produce a playable prototype which will be exhibited at the end of the semester. 

### Reading Week
Over reading week you should read and respond to the text and use appropriate research methods. This will involve utilising methodologies that were introduced to you in the first brief. 

Read the text and make notes, sketches, diagrams, collect quotes and draw. What is it about? What are its main themes? Who are the characters? Can you draw any parallels with contemporary life? What is its tone of voice? What visual imagery does it conjure? 
What abstract visual connections does it inspire, what typefaces does it make you think of?

You are to explore and collect and generate a range of material that will explain a theme. Think about a visual language - what colours, sounds, textures, keywords can you connect? Research will help push these ideas further and allow you to be more creative, and make less obvious/literal choices. 

After reading week on Tuesday (17th of Nov) you will take part in a series of workshops that will help you challenge your existing understanding of Romeo and Juliet. For these workshops you must bring a theme (or series of themes) connected to the play that you have identified as of interest and any existing research into that theme. You should also bring exciting/relevant quotes or a passage of text you enjoyed.
