> It is the task of the translator to release in his own language that pure language that is under the spell of another, to liberate the language imprisoned in a work in his re-creation of that work – Walter Benjamin

### Intro
You are now to develop from your research and edit sequence a proposal for a new game world via a visual presentation* and communicate your idea through your documentation, you should prepare all your supporting material for this session. 
_*NOTE this does not have to be a powerpoint presentation*_

## Presentations will take place on the 6th of Nov 2015

All work/ sketches/ notes/ photocopies/ sketchbooks for this should be collated and bound. This work will be presented for all to view as as you present your idea.

At this stage of the course we want you to be quite broad in your interpretation of the task. Use your collate research to drive your decisions to shape your idea, your documentation could include storyline ideas, sprite sheets, film clips, sound examples, animation, colour palettes, sample characters, concept art,  paradigms, mechanic concepts, features, interface, typographic choices, style, metaphors etc. Your presentation could even include prototypes for demonstrating characteristics of your idea.

Do not be deterred by what technically you can make, if you can’t make it, propose it through visuals, storyboards or animatics. You can use found sound and video top mash up an idea. You need to sell the idea of the game to the rest of your cohort. 

It's the end of your first project so be ambitious and extend what you have done previously. It is OK if you make mistakes, you should be making mistakes at this stage of the course.

This project is about ideas generation and this means throwing away as much as you keep, your presentation should convey the experience and the concept of your game that will get others excited about your idea.
