# Understand 
## 1.1 : Observe & Record

> The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. Each evening we see the sun set. We know that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight â€“ John Berger, Ways of Seeing


### Intro
This assignment introduces you to a structured process of visual analysis that will allow you to gain insights from a given starting point. These insights will then enable you to build a visual language from your research. On Monday the 5th of October, a workshop will explain how we define visual research and provide some methodologies on how to approach it for this assignment.

### Task
You are required to capture the essence of a specific location. The Studio based workshop will outline methods and approaches to gathering visual research in preparation for a field trip to Brighton on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

One of the following locations will be provided to you on the coach;

Locations http://dctr.pro/brighton
1. Queens Park
2. The Level
3. Brighton Pier
4. Brighton train station
5. Snoopers Paradise
6. Royal Pavilion
7. Kemp Town

### Observational thinking
- What are the predominant shapes/ colours/ forms within your location?
- What are the materials used?
- Use words / text descriptions
- Visually what does what you see tell you? Are there positives/negatives? dark & light?
- How are people interacting with your location?
- Consider all the senses including smells and sound

### Activities to be completed by end of each day.
#### DAY 1 - Static  / Draw / Trace
Tools - Pens, crayons, pencils.  
Use both sketchbooks provided.

- Produce quick 2 minute sketches of all of the major exhibits in your area.
- Record all the colours you can see.
- Record all the tones you can see.
- Record all the shapes you can see.
- Using a thick marker or black pastel produce 5 silhouettes of 10 objects/items you can see.  
- Create a series of colour studies from the location. Gradually simplify and limit the colours you are using.
- Create 5 x 10 minute line drawings of the shapes/objects/ people that are of most interest you. 
- Create 50 x 10 second drawings using a thick marks, and 50 x 10 second drawings using thin. Consider scale, and how you are using your sketchbook
- Create a series of studies that break part of your location into abstract shapes.
- Create a series of studies of parts of your location that first use 10 lines, then 5 lines, then 3 lines, then 2 lines, then 1. 
- Draw an item in your location from observation, then from memory, then from records and memory combined.
- Identify a predominant shape in your location, and draw this shape 20 times- considering scale, composition, materials and spreads.
- Using the words/descriptions you note down - create new drawings from these descriptions.
- At least 10 drawings of negative.
- Use the Hand of a fellow student to draw. 
- Use your wrong hand to draw.

#### DAY 2  - Motion / Capture / Record
Tools - Digital & analogue tools. 
Use Digital Scrapbook as a repository.

- Explore periphery information.
- Record the space around the main objects/characters/buildings you can see.
- Study the light across your space.
- Pick a building, or structure. Draw it from the front, then behind, then above, then look away. and write a description based on memory.
- Create a sequence of drawings or photographs of one element across time.
- A short loop film. (like an animated gif)
- 24 photos of one specific colour.
- Time sampling / Time shift. (look at what happens to the space / object over a period of time)
- A Hyperlapse. 
- Documentary style video. (1 min max)
- Macro film.
- Animate a space.
- Film a character.
- Capture a soundscape. 
- Capture a piece of motion. (waves, machines)
- Record a series of fleeting moments with your camera.
- Create a series of images that are so tightly cropped their subject is unrecognisable.
- Create an alphabet with your camera from letterforms that exist in the environment.
- Photograph as many different horizons as you can.

On Monday 12th October you will present everything produced on your field trip to the other students.
