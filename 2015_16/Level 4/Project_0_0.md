> When the image is new, the world is new
Gaston Bachelard, The Poetics of Space

### Introduction
What we capture from first hand experience is invaluable in informing what we shape in our minds about that experience. First impressions matter but equally what we choose to include from an encounter says something about who we are.

### Task 
Working in groups you will create a four minute film that communicates your impression of Winchester and the surrounding areas. This should incorporate at least two of the set activities below and be presented to fellow students on Friday.


#### MONDAY
Please find your given location at the end of this brief. Once on location you will record what you see, hear, smell, feel. You must use ONLY a audio recorder to capture a description of your location. Try to gather as much information as possible whilst at your location. Consider descriptive language in response to the space, feelings evoked, items you can see and nature, and the essence of the place. Your audio description will be the focal point for your response back in the studio.

#### TUESDAY
All teams will be given a starter kit; containing cardboard, tape, pens, adhesive and found objects, but you should add to this from things that you find yourself. Use these to create the outcome of this project in the forms of a a portable 3D structure. Each member of your team should contribute to the construction of your structure.

### Considerations
Observe and explore. Consider: colour, texture, language, relationships, people, mannerisms, language, sounds, social life, culture, racial or socio demographics, landscape, architecture, weather, infrastructure, transport, food, fashion, signage, horticulture and anything that you feel is indicative to the particular visual character of your place. At first you may feel that where you are is just like anywhere else, but you need to drill down and reflect more deeply on what is there. 

Remember you need to capture all of this as an audio description, and this will be the only reference you will have when building your structure in the studio.
