# 1.2 Project Bradbeer 
## This is for the players. 

### Introduction 

> I've been a gamer all my life - Tiger Woods

During this project you will use a structured process to develop an innovative theme based miniature golf course. This course will be both digital and physical, culminating in a live play event at the end of the project. 

### Task  
In teams you will each create a single hole with ramps, curves and other obstacles to create a multihole collectively themed crazy/mini golf course. 

You will need to research physics, mini golf in general and connected concepts and history. Some avenues of research will be outlined in the launch. You will need to use this research to inform your decisions for the types of obstacles you will be creating alongside the look and feel of the course. 

On Monday the 15th of Feb each team will pitch a theme that the course should take and voting will decide the theme to carry through to the final designs. Each team will take the theme and interpret and deepen the concept and apply this to the design of there hole. 

On Friday 26th of Feb we will invite guests, staff and students to come and play your course, on the lawn outside the Students Union, you will use this session to gain **additional** external user feedback and should consider this as a user testing session.  This will be an event and all teams should dress for the occasion.

### Research
Your research should include: target audience and analysis of the phenomena know as crazy golf. This will inform your choices and should create individual portfolio of broad and deep knowledge. Make sure your document and record all workshop activity alongside your own research, testing and prototypes.

First hand research should be undertaken, aka go and play mini golf, talk to / email minigolf enthusiasts. Become a mini golf mini expert.
