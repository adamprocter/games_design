# 1.1 BOARD

### Introduction 


> A board game is a game that involves counters or pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or "board", according to a set of rules. Games can be based on pure strategy, chance (e.g. rolling dice), or a mixture of the two, and usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve  (2015)

During this project you will use a structured process to develop a board game. You board game should use one of these key words to determine the theme and parameters.

# **Chance /Memory/ Failure /Collaboration**  

### Task  
In teams you will each create a playable physical board game. This should not be a remake of a current board game and visual design or an overly complicated narrative should not feature, please note the game can feature the use of cards but should be board game based. The games core should be based on your choosen theme and you need to ensure choices such as specific rules are dictated by the theme but most importantly whether the game has playability.  This sounds simple but to create a compelling new board game is not an easy task.

You must quickly research and more importantly play as many games as possible to understand what could make a great rule based game.

In workshops for this project we will outline agile methods and conditional design approaches to support iterative, user centred design, you will use these methods to improve your design via iterations and pivots and this will involve a series of user tests and rapid prototyping.   It is key that you use feedback and rapid prototyping to iterate your game.  Feel free to use the 3d printer in the studio to make pieces and dice.

#### Theme based video games

The following game was created from the theme
#### **Immortal, learn to die** 
[http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/1](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/1)

You can see the game was made in 72 hours after the theme was chosen and then released for comments, the game was then improved over the next few weeks. Compare the 72 hour version to the finished game.

In total six games were created this way from different themes at the following URLs
[http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/2](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/1)   or  **/3**  or  **/4** or  **/5** or  **/6**

Although these are video games this should give you some ideas around theme game construction and user feedback decision making.

On Friday 6th of Feb we will invite staff and students to come and play your games, you will use this session to gain **additional** external user feedback and should consider this a user testing session. 

### Research
Your research should include: target audience / top played / your favourites, quickly analyse why a specific game is good.
First hand research should be undertaken in The Toy Cupboard in Winchester, see what they have, ask what the sell, ask what they are looking to buy.  http://thetoycupboard.co.uk/
