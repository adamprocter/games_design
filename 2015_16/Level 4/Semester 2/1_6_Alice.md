# 1.6 Alice's Adventures Underground

### Introduction 

During this project you will use a structured process to develop a game prototype. You will need to collate, organise and prioritise the research within each theme (underground, gardens and oxford) along with an understanding of the Alice's Adventures Underground text to produce a vibrant portfolio of work and a working game prototype.

You game concept, documentation and prototype should embrace and be informed by the collated team theme (underground,oxford, gardens) research and the Alice's Adventures Underground text.

### Task  

**Easter Break >**  Read the Story Alice's Adventures Underground. Think about it’s significance and make notes on anything it makes you think. 

- What is it about? 
- What are its main themes? 
- Who are the characters? 
- Can you draw any parallels with contemporary life? What is its tone of voice? 
- What visual imagery does it conjure?

**After Easter >** 

You must prepare a [PechaKucha](http://www.pechakucha.org/faq) presentation for your team and me on the 18th of April (14:00). 

> PechaKucha is a simple presentation format where you show 20 images, each for 20 seconds. The images advance automatically and you talk along to the images. - http://www.pechakucha.org/faq

This PechaKucha should be a pitch for the overall aims, direction and concepts you suggest the Alice project should take based on your insights from not only the text but also Gardens, Oxford and Underground.

You will then in your teams create materials and a prototype game. 

Each team must assign all of the following roles into there team

The roles must be the following ONLY;

- Lead Researcher (collected idea, concepts, audience , market)
- Narrative Design (story / research)
- Art Director  (Art direction / style guide)
- Lead Artist (2d / 3D creation)
- Lead Designer (Game play / mechanics / features)
- Tech Developer (game engine / realisation)


Your game does not need to be a video game, the technical developer may lead the team in the creation of board game, physical game or other game concept, however (obviously) the outcome should support the game idea.

These materials you create should sit within your role and could include concept art, level design documentation, rapid prototypes, paper prototypes, 2d and 3d assets, scripting (programming) tests, narrative development, character development, audio sample, video moodboards, pintrest boards.(this is not a exhaustive list.)

This is a chance to culminate the skills and concepts from your previous workshops throughout Semester 1 and 2 such as user testing, agile methods, gameplay mechanics,  conditional design, 6 hats creative thinking, narrative branching, iterative concepts, user centred design, play testing, rules, design thinking, minimum viable products etc. You can consider themes from your contemporary issues work as well.  It is key that you use user feedback and rapid prototyping to iterate your ideas quickly and appropriately.

### Research
There are interpretations of Alice to suit every taste
Such as :
 - Alice in Wonderland - Tim Burton
- Alice (1988 film) -  Jan Švankmajer
 - http://gamecity.org/alices-adventures-off-the-map
 - http://www.brainpickings.org/2011/11/15/salvador-dali-alice-in-wonderland-1969/
 -  http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/10/alice-in-wonderland-illustrated-by-ralph-steadman/

Although the game should be based on the research gathered and ideas sparked from this evidence and the Alice text your should consider research into: target audience / top played / your favourites / competition / platform.

#### A sample of rapid 3 day hack. Theme based video games

The following game was created from the theme
#### **Immortal, learn to die** 
[http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/1](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/1)

You can see the game was made in 72 hours after the theme was chosen and then released for comments, the game was then improved over the next few weeks. Compare the 72 hour version to the finished game.

In total six games were created this way from different themes at the following URLs

### Assessment evidence
 
 - Team Presentation of work from Semester 2 on the 12th & 13th of May to Staff.
 - All supporting work/ sketches/ notes/ photocopies sketchbooks should be collated and bound for hand in after presentation on Thursday 14th of May.
