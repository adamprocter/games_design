# 1.2 GEO LOCATION - Time and Place. 

### Introduction 

> Even if you're not doing anything wrong, you are being watched and recorded. - Edward Snowden

During this project you will use a structured process to develop a geo location based product or experience.  Moments in time and location can reveal many details about our lives. Our location can be used to deliver specific communications with us to enhance our lives, this can be via simply knowing you are in the UK and providing web site payments in sterling or it could be an augmented reality that informs you with real time information based on a very specific location on the planet. Location based learning is becoming a new feature of Education due to the proliferation of mobile devices. You will need to research in a broad manner to create a compelling and new geo location based experience.

### Task  
In teams you will each create a Kickstarter project for a geo location product or experience. You will need to create an account and upload the project, it does not have to go live. 

Your project does not have to be a game but must use location as the core driver for the project. Your Kickstarter project should be built using Kickstarter and although Kickstarter does state you do not have to create a video for a project for this brief you must.

Projects to look at should include;
I Love Bees   / Alternate reality games
Fire Chat   /  Mesh Networks
Chromaroma  / Mudlark - http://wearemudlark.com/blog/
GamAR /  http://gamar.com/

You will need to quickly research and more importantly investigate as many geo location possibilities as you can to understand what could make a great geo based product.

It is key that you use user feedback and rapid prototyping to iterate your idea.  Feel free to dive into the technology we have within the mobile device lab, google glass and the onyx beacons. We will look at these products in the tutor groups. However this project is about creating a pitch for Kickstarter and so it is the idea and project that should hold up to scrutiny. 

#### Additional geo based projects to consider

Kennedy App

> Capture the now with Kennedy
> A new way to mark moments in time complete with surrounding context of the things happening around you.

Now Next Later

> Now Next Later is a subtle weather app for iOS
> Instead of the expected weather icons, Now Next Later uses a cross based particle system to show current conditions including rain, wind speed, clouds and snow.

Ingress 

> Ingress.  The game.
It's happening all around you. They
aren't coming. They're already here. 

http://www.openpaths.cc

> OpenPaths is a secure data locker for personal location information. Using our mobile apps you can track your location, visualise where you've been, and upload your data to the OpenPaths website. 

OpenStreetMap

> OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.

SCVNGR

> SCVNGR was a social location-based gaming platform for mobile phones

noTours 

> noTours is a project by the collective Escoitar.org that allows editing a place with sounds. This means that you can attach sounds to a territory and that later, when you go physically to that place, you can listen to them.

Augmented Reality Games  
> Portal ARG / Star Trek ARG

Foursquare /  Swarm 
> Location based check ins and reviews.
