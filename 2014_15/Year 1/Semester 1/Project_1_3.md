# 1.0 Cultural Identities
## 1.3 Synthesise & Articulate

### Introduction 
Over the next part of this project you will use a structured process to develop the insights that have provided you a start point for you idea and create documentation to appropriately communicate your idea. 

### Task  
Having created a basic proposal for a new world/ environment and core values/ parameters that help define this environment from the evidence you researched at the British Museum, you are now to develop this proposal into a visual presentation* and communicate your idea through your documentation, you should prepare all your supporting material for this session. All work/ sketches/ notes/ photocopies/ sketchbooks for this should be collated and bound. This work will be presented for all to view as as you present your idea.

_*NOTE this should not be a powerpoint presentation*_

At this stage of the course we want you to be quite broad in your interpretation of the task. Use your evidence to drive your decisions to shape your idea, your documentation could include storyline ideas, sprite sheets, film clips, sound examples, animation, colour palettes, sample characters, concept art,  paradigms, mechanic concepts, features, interface, typographic choices, style, metaphors etc. Your presentation could include prototypes for demonstrating characteristics of your idea.

Do not be deterred by what technically you can make, if you canâ€™t make it, propose it through visuals, storyboards or animatics. You can use found sound and video to make. You need to sell the idea of the game to the rest of your cohort. 

It's the end of your first project so be ambitious and extend what you have done previously. It is OK if you make mistakes, you should be making mistakes at this stage of the course.

This project is about ideas generation and this means throwing away as much as you keep, your presentation should convey the experience and the concept of your game that gets others excited about your idea.
