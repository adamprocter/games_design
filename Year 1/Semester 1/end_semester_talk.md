# Why reflection  is important

- Allows you to stand back and assess your work in a more detached light.
- Deepen your initial thoughts, as by this stage you will have had the benefit of hindsight to guide you.
- Examining both your positive and negative experiences can help you understand why you approach things in certain ways and avoid others.

---

- Solving problems can become easier if you regularly reflect upon your practice. 
- Quotes are useful for illustrating key points.

# bad reflection

- general overview of events, and does not highlight any critical incidents 
- There is little or nothing said about things that did not go well for you â€“ only positive events are discussed
- In cases where a problem is identified, you do not take ownership of the situation, and see others as responsible
- There's no detailed discussion about what you've learnt, and how things could be done differently in the future
