# BA (Hons) Games Design & Art

Welcome to BA (Hons) Games Design & Art at Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton.

## Rationale

Before your arrival in September we would like you to give you two tasks.

## Aims
To collect and collate data to communicate a local narrative via a presentation.

## Outcome
By the end of the project you will have collated data that represents a unique mapped location near your home.

## Task 1 - Reading matter

Firstly we would like you to do some reading. Choose at least one of the following books and read it from **cover** to **cover**:

- Kahneman, D. (2012) Thinking, Fast and Slow. Penguin UK.
- Bierut, M. (2008) 79 Short Essays on Design. Chronicle Books.
- McLuhan, M. and Fiore, Q. (2011) The Medium Is the Massage. Gingko PressInc.


## Task 2 - Location & narrative

We want you to collect data a location near where you are from: 
the county, city, town, village, street, building or estate.
Using this data we would like you to create the components for a narrative for a unique location.

To do this we are asking you to perform a Psychogeograpic data collection about an area near your home.

You will then present your collection of data in anyway that you feel is appropriate in the first week of term. Think about what the data is and look at examples for reference.

To create a unique Psychogeograpic data collection we would like you to unfold a physical map of your local area (home), place a glass, rim down, anywhere on the map, and draw round it’s edge. Pick up the map, and walk the circle, keep as close as you can to the curve. 

Record the experience as you go, in whatever medium you favour: film, photograph, manuscript, tape. Catch the textual run-off of the street; the graffiti, the branded litter, the snatches of conversation. Cut for sign. Log the data-stream. 

Brendan Dawes has provided Games Design & Art with free codes for  his app Kennedy (see code in your personal letter / email), so if you have an iPhone this could be a very useful way to capture your data.

> Capture the now with Kennedy
> A new way to mark moments in time complete with surrounding context of the things happening around you.

Be alert to the happenstance of metaphors, watch for visual rhymes, coincidences, analogies, the changing moods of the street. Complete the circle, and the record ends. Walking makes for content; footage for footage.

Use these techniques to examine: 
colour, texture, language, relationships, mannerisms, slang, social life, culture, people, racial or social demographics, landscape, architecture, weather, infrastructure, transport, food, fashion, signage, horticulture and anything that you feel is indicative to where you are.

Collate this data into some sort of package, receptacle, bound document or digital artefact. 

**Then using this data create a presentation that specifies components that can be used to communicate a narrative.** 


#### Things to think about
 
At first sight you may feel that where you are is just like anywhere else, but as a potential game designer you need to look past the surface.

Consider the memories and associations you have and what are the important historical moments. 

#### Links and Reference points

Do not try to work out what we want to see. Do what we are asking you to do and your narrative _will reveal itself_.

#### Required outcomes

- Evidence of your visual data collated into some sort package. This could be a sketchbook but it doesn’t have to be.

- The data together form the components of your 'home' and you will use these to communicate the things that you have discovered.



## Brief set 28.07.14

### Profesional Practice
 
Please ensure that your chosen route does not endanger yourself or others, you should not travel the route on your own, please do so with a friend, we would expect you to follow this route during the day time. If the space is private land or you are unable to visit that space on your route, then make sensible decisions on a detour.

### Crit / Exhibition
 
Please ensure you bring your work with you when you to your first sessions in September / October. You will be asked to present your data. 

### Assessment 

Although this project is not formally assessed, it will be reviewed and feed into your practice in the new academic year.
