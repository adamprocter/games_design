# Level Up -- Year 1 > Year 2

This project is to be completed before your arrival back in Week 1 September 28th.

## Introduction

> A game design document (often abbreviated GDD) is a highly descriptive living design document of the design for a video game. A GDD is created and edited by the development team and it is primarily used in the video game industry to organize efforts within a development team. The document is created by the development team as result of collaboration between their designers, artists and programmers as a guiding vision which is used throughout the game development process. When a game is commissioned by a game publisher to the development team, the document must be created by the development team and it is often attached to the agreement between publisher and developer; the developer has to adhere to the GDD during game development process. (Wikipedia)

During this project you will use a structured process to deconstruct **three** games into the component parts that would have formed the original games design document. 

## Aims
To deconstruct and analyse **three** games into the component parts that you believe could have made up the original Games Design Document (GDD). This will provide you with insight into the games you have chosen and will deepen you understanding of the games design decisions that have been applied. 

## Outcome
By the end of the summer you will have collated research and insight into each game, you will have an understanding of the core components that make up the finished product and you will be able to give a 10 minute presentation on your findings. This presentation could be very informative and a pure deconstruction of the game and its influences or you may have findings that provide further insight into GDD's and could include that, perhaps there are trends, signposts or tricks you think are employed.

## Game Design Document Overview
In Semester 1 we will go into detail and you will spend a sustained period to create your own GDD's so at this stage you do not need to fully understand all of the GDD however what we would like you to consider is the component parts that would typically go into a GDD and extract those elements out of your chosen games. You should deconstruct the games using methods and techniques from Year 1, look at your workshop/ tutor notes. You should locate why you like or dislike certain elements within the game and how such elements maybe connected or create constraints/ rules to dictate parts that make up a game.  _Your games do NOT have to be video games._

Attached are three different Game Design Documents for your reference.

We suggest that you use the following headings to start to deconstruct your games into their component parts that would have likely formed the original GDD.

- Game Overview
- Game Features
- Game Controls 
- Game Mechanics 
- Game Attributes

Wikipedia is a good starting point to find out more about GDD's but **should** only be the start and we will be looking into GDD detail in Semester 1. However this is useful background reading for the Summer.

### Crit

- **Presentation of your findings in Week 1 to educate and inform the rest of the year what you have found out. This should include visuals, video and audio.**

- Please ensure you bring your research work with you as well  to this session. 

### Assessment 

Although this project is not formally assessed, it will be reviewed and feed into your practice in the new academic year.
