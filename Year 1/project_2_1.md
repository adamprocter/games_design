# 2.0 Romeo & Juliet
## 2.1 Analyse & Respond

### Introduction

A number of versions of Romeo & Juliet use dance and movement too play a key role, looking at either the Royal Ballet or West side story interpretations, you will need to identify a movement within the play/ film that will form the core mechanic for a game you will research and develop as teams. Ultimately You need to produce a playable prototype which will be exhibited at the end of the semester. 

You will bring familiar subject matter alive in a new and innovate way. Romeo & Juliet is one of Shakespeare’s most popular plays and it is also a play that is very open to interpretation. This assignment provides you with the opportunity to examine this timeless text and requires you to find new and interesting ways to excite an audience about what you find, however core to your decisions around content is that the movement you choose plays a key driver in your game, this project is all about mechanics first. 

You will need to use the investigative skills learnt in project 1.0, along with this new content and new workshops skills to produce a vibrant portfolio of work and a working prototype.

### Task

**03/11 > 05/11:** Read the play. Think about it’s significance and make notes on anything it makes you think. What is it about? What are its main themes? Who are the characters? Can you draw any parallels with contemporary life? What is its tone of voice? What visual imagery does it conjure?

**05/11:** We will screen a version of Romeo & Juliet at 13:00 in the Games Studio. Please bring sketchbooks and utilise this event as a valuable piece of primary research.

**07/11:** You will take part in a studio workshop that will involve a series of visual exploration exercises that allow you to respond to audio visual stimulation that relates to themes contained within the play.


### Research
There are interpretations of Shakespeare’s Romeo & Juliet
to suit every taste. From Baz Luhrmann’s cool 1990’s interpretation (http://www.romeoandjuliet.com/) to West Side Story in the 50’s (http://www.filmsite.org/wests.html)
to Franco Zefirelli’s 1960’s classic production. There are
