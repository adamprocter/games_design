# 1.0 Cultural Identities
## 1.1 Observe & Record

### Introduction
This project introduces you to a structured process of visual analysis that will allow you to gain insights that will enable you to build a visual language that is appropriate to a subject. 

### Task
On the 6th & 7th of October you will take part in a field trip to the British Museum. You should bring an A4 sketchbook along with a selection of dry drawing materials. i.e: markers, fineliners, graphite sticks, pencils, pastels, coloured pencils and pastels.

On the coach you will be given one of the following areas of the Museum to research:
Africa/ Egypt/ Greece/ Assyria/ India/ Islam
When you arrive at the museum, you are then to spend the afternoon working on the following exercises (record everything you do in your sketchbook)

### Observation
- Collect material (leaflets etc).
- Write notes / reflections.
	- this can be a bullet list or longer text on its own or annotating your images.
- Take lots of photos (use your phone) take at least 50 images
	- don't use filters
- Record sounds (use your phone)
- Shoot at least 5 minutes of video 
	- don't use filters
 
	> Kennedy App, DayOne or Evernote apps could be used to take an image with notes on your device. 

- Produce quick 2 minute sketches of all of the major exhibits in this area.
- Using a thick marker or black pastel produce 5 silhouettes of these exhibits 
- Create a series of colour studies from the exhibits in your room. Gradually simplify and limit the colours you are using.
- Create 5x10 minute line drawings of the exhibits that most interest you. 
- Now choose one large scale exhibit and produce the following:
	- A series of studies that break the exhibit down into abstract shapes.
	- Create a series of studies of your exhibit that first use 10 lines, then 5 lines, then 3 lines, then 2 lines, then 1.
	- Modify one of your drawings into a simple iconic image (think about a logo if this helps)

### Observational thinking
- What are the predominant materials in your room?
- What are the predominant shapes/ colours/ forms?
- Describe the exhibits around you using words. Visually what do they tell you about the culture they represent? Are they aggressive? warlike? spiritual? peaceful? powerful? passive? ordered? chaotic? hedonistic? stoic? etc...
- Find clues to the cultural activities of your culture: food rituals/ sexual preferences/ pleasure/ religion/ sport/ power
- What are the icons and deities? animals/ monarchy/ gods/ dress/ objects/ materials/ hairstyles
- What are the values of your culture. sex/ pleasure/ family/ power/ war/ work/ collaboration/ order/ hierarchy/ anarchy
- Collect as much visual material as you can including leaflets and postcards. 

Spend the week developing this material and following up your own research. Explore the research sources that we suggest below.

We will launch 1.2 on the 10th of October. 

Please bring all your your research for the tutorial session of Monday the 13th October.

### Research

Use the British Museum website and find out as much as you can about your culture. Make sure you visit the 'History of the World in 100 Objects' homepage and listen to the radio shows and podcasts.
