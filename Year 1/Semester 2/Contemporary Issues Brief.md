# 1.1 Contemporary Issues in Games Design & Art

### Introduction 

#### Aims
- to introduce you to the ways in which contemporary contexts and theories inform games design and art practice - to introduce the ways in which games artists and games designers engage with ideas- to encourage you to explore your own work through critical reflection on the debates and practices of game design and art and see the applicability of these to your own work

The Contemporary Issues module has been designed to facilitate your development of skills necessary for the critical development of well-informed contemporary games design and art. We will explore how practice is informed by context and theory. In the weekly sessions, we will look critically at the contemporary world of games and gaming and examine this with relevant related texts. We will discuss major concepts and key positions and evaluate the relevance and significance of differing perspectives in the world within and outside the creative industries. Through this work we will encourage you to explore practically how the current developments in the games can inform your own programme-specific work.
