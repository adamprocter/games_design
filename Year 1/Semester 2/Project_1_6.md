# 1.6 Alices Adventures in Wonderland

### Introduction 


> 

During this project you will use a structured process to develop a game prototype. You will need to collate, organise and prioritise the research within each theme (underground, gardens and oxford) along with an understanding of the Alice in Wonderland text to produce a vibrant portfolio of work and a working game prototype.

You game concept, documentation and prototype should embrace and be informed by the collated team theme (underground,oxford, gardens) research and the Alice in Wonderland Text.

### Task  

**Easter >**  Read the Story Alices Adventures in Wonderland. Think about it’s significance and make notes on anything it makes you think. What is it about? What are its main themes? Who are the characters? Can you draw any parallels with contemporary life? What is its tone of voice? What visual imagery does it conjure?

In teams you will each create materials and a prototype game. These materials can include concept art, level design documentation, rapid prototypes, paper prototypes, 2d and 3d assets, scripting (programming) tests, narrative development, character development, audio sample, video moodboards, pintrest boards.(this is not a exhaustive list.)

This is a chance to culminate the skills and concepts from your previous workshops throughout Semester 1 and 2 such as user testing, agile methods, gameplay mechanics,  conditional design, 6 hats creative thinking, narrative branching, iterative concepts, user centred design, play testing, rules, design thinking, minimum viable products etc. You can consider themes from your contemporary issues work as well.  It is key that you use user feedback and rapid prototyping to iterate your ideas quickly and appropriately.

### Research
There are interpretations of Alice to suit every taste
Such as :
 - Alice in Wonderland - Tim Burton
-  Alice (1988 film) -  Jan Švankmajer

 - http://www.brainpickings.org/2011/11/15/salvador-dali-alice-in-wonderland-1969/
 -  http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/10/alice-in-wonderland-illustrated-by-ralph-steadman/

Although the game should be based on the research gathered and ideas sparked from this evidence and the Alice text your should consider research into: target audience / top played / your favourites / competition / platform.


#### A sample of rapid 3 day hack. Theme based video games

The following game was created from the theme
#### **Immortal, learn to die** 
[http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/1](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/1)

You can see the game was made in 72 hours after the theme was chosen and then released for comments, the game was then improved over the next few weeks. Compare the 72 hour version to the finished game.

In total six games were created this way from different themes at the following URLs
