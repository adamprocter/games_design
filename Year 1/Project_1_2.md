# 1.0 Cultural Identities
## 1.2 Analyse & Interpret

### Introduction
This project introduces you to a structured process of visual analysis that will allow you to gain insights that will provide insights that will enable you to build a visual language that is appropriate to a subject. 

### Task
> "It seems to me that the creative process is one that re-examines those things we already know and understand, and forces us to reconsider them, usually involving insight to their nature. The creative act is an act that transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary." 
> Saul Bass

We now want you to interpret what you observed at the British Museum and in your further research.

The dictionary definition of interpret is: 
- To explain the meaning of...
- To conceive the significance of...
- To present or conceptualise.
- To translate orally (or visually).
- To offer an explanation.

On Monday 13th October you will take part in a series of exercises within your tutor group that will allow you to unpack what you have discovered about your civilisation. We want you to get to the core of what this civilisation and try to pinpoint the visual elements that best communicate its essence. These elements will then form the basis for parameters/ rules/ values from which you will create a proposal that will in Project 1_3 extrapolate into visuals, objects and characters that could form components for a new world/ environment.

You are then to develop a presentation that will explain the concept behind your new world/ environment to the group and deliver this in the morning of Friday 17th October.

1_3 will Launch on Monday the 20th Oct in your tutor group.
